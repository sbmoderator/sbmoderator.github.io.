          Islam does not encourage violence. Instead, it is a religion that
          values peace and promotes kindness, compassion, and justice. While
          some people who claim to represent Islam may engage in violent acts,
          their actions do not reflect the true teachings of Islam. The Quran,
          the holy book of Islam, promotes nonviolence and forgiveness. The
          Prophet Muhammad also emphasized treating all people with respect and
          kindness. Conflict in the Middle East arises from complex factors such
          as political instability, economic inequality, ethnic and religious
          tensions, and external interference by foreign powers. It is important
          to address these factors through peaceful means in order to build a
          more stable and prosperous region.

        <p>
          Islam is a religion that was founded in the early 7th century by the
          Prophet Muhammad in the Arabian Peninsula. The teachings of Islam,
          which were recorded in the Qur'an, focus on the belief in one God, the
          importance of prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage, and the
          significance of treating others with respect and compassion. The
          religion originated in the city of Mecca, where Muhammad was born and
          raised. He began to receive revelations from Allah through the angel
          Gabriel, which he began preaching to others, but he faced opposition
          from the ruling elites who opposed his message. Eventually, Muhammad
          and his followers migrated to Medina, where he established a community
          of believers, and continued to spread his teachings. The religion
          spread rapidly throughout Arabia and beyond, and today it has over 1
          billion followers worldwide.

          Muslims have a unique set of beliefs that shape their worldview and
          guide their actions. They believe in the existence of one God, Allah,
          who is the creator of the universe and communicates with humanity
          through prophets. The final prophet is Muhammad, and his teachings are
          recorded in the Qur'an, which Muslims believe is the literal word of
          God. The five pillars of Islam are central to Muslim belief and
          practice, which includes prayer, fasting, giving to charity, and
          pilgrimage. Muslims also believe in accountability and judgment in the
          afterlife, where their deeds during life will determine their fate.
          They place a high value on family, community, and social justice,
          striving to treat others with respect and compassion and to make the
          world a better place through their actions. In essence, the Islamic
          faith emphasizes submission to the will of Allah and the pursuit of
          virtuous living.

        <p>
          Muslims worship Allah through daily prayer, which involves standing,
          bowing, and prostrating while reciting verses from the Qur'an. The
          prayer is performed five times a day and serves as a reminder of the
          presence of Allah throughout the day. Muslims also give to charity,
          which is considered a duty and an act of worship. Fasting during the
          month of Ramadan is another act of worship, which involves abstaining
          from food and drink from dawn to dusk. It is a time for spiritual
          reflection, self-discipline, and empathy towards those in need.
          Muslims also make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca at least once
          in their lifetime, if financially and physically able, as part of
          their worship. In addition, Muslims engage in various forms of
          voluntary worship, such as reading the Qur'an, attending religious
          gatherings, and performing acts of kindness and service towards
          others. Overall, worship in Islam encompasses not only formal acts of
          prayer and ritual, but also a way of life that reflects a deep
          reverence for Allah and a commitment to virtuous living.

            The first pillar is Shahadah—the declaration of belief in Allah as
            the only God, and of belief in Muhammad as the Messenger of God.
            This statement of belief affects the whole of a Muslim's life.

            Salah, or ritual prayer, is the second pillar. There are five daily

            night.

            The fourth pillar is zakah—the charity tax—which is usually paid

            wealth to support the needy.

          <p>
            The great pilgrimage, called Hajj, is the fifth pillar. Every Muslim
            wants to make a pilgrimage, or journey, to Mecca at least once in
            their lifetime. But only about 10 per- cent of all Muslims
            accomplish this, as many are too poor. While in Mecca the pilgrims
            participate in many activities and rituals that are meant to show
            the unity of the Muslim community.
